"""
------------------------------- TO DO ------------------------------------------
You are the proud owner of a brand new casino.
Your casino only has one game, the roulette, and only one table for the moment.
Your goal is to extend your casino, in order to have more roulette tables, and own the biggest casino !

Rules:
    - The casino opens every day.
    - As the manager, you can decide what to do with the casino after each day.
    - Each of your roulette tables handles from 10 to 50 players a day.
    - Each player must bid at least 100$ to play at a table.
    - Each player has 90% chances to lose a random amount of money between 100$ and his entire wallet.
    - Each player has 10% chances to leave the casino with more money than when he entered.
    - The maximum gain amount of a player is 100% of his original wallet
        (i.e. if he enters with 1000$, he can leave with a maximum of 2000$).
    - Adding a roulette costs 3500$, removing it gets you 1500$ back.
    - Each roulette table costs 350$ a day to the casino (to pay the croupier)

Hint: use classes !

Bonus: Make a graphical version with the graphical library of your choice !
Many are available: tkinter, Qt, SDL, SFML, ncurses...
