# workshop_python_intro
## A workshop about the basics of Python for the Epitech Hub

* For each exercise, you can read what you have to do at the beginning of the associated Python file.

* Sometimes, there will also be hints or code snippets included in the Python files.
  The snippets are either help or tests for your exercise, so that you know if your code is functioning or not.

### The correction will be done in live code, throughout the workshop.

## If you have questions, do not hesitate to ask.
