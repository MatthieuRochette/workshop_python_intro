"""
------------------------------- TO DO ------------------------------------------
Write a program that takes a string (with input()) and prints it, but changes
every letter for the next one in the alphabet.
If you encounter the letter 'z', your program must give out an 'a'.

!!! Your program must be case-sensitive !!!

#Hint: take a look at functions ord() and chr()
